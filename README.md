The goal of the problem was to use the power of data analytics to analyse IPL matches and build your IPL Dream Team.

The Competition was in Two phases:
1) In this stage of the problem we needed to build a model that could identify the top-50 major events in the match.
 A major event here could be anything ranging from the fall of a key wicket or 6 sixes, to just taking a single on the last ball of the last over. 
 In short we had to look for events that had a strong impact on the match.
2) In second stage, we needed to analyse 10 given matches of IPL 2017 and give players a rating in each match and an average rating for
 the whole tournament, based on which, we had to make a Dream Team of the tournament.
